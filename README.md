# NPM Package using ng-packagr

Writing a typescript library is HARD.  The `@angular/cli`
has tools for creating one, but I want to have to include
as little as possible to build my library.

## Log

I created this directory and ran `npm init -y` inside it,
and created this `README.md` file and a `.gitignore`
file to ignore node_modules. ('First Commit')

I ran `npm install -D ng-packagr`
